### **Step 2: Start the Backend (Server)**
You must have the backend running for the app to work. 

1. **Go to the backend folder:**
   ```bash
   cd backend/zero-knowledge
   ```
2. **Install dependencies (only needed the first time):**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Start the server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
*⚠️ Keep this terminal window open!*

   ```
3. **Go to the frontend folder:**
