POST MAN - API testing tool
TECH STACK :
Node.js – runtime to execute JavaScript on the server
Express.js – to build REST APIs
MongoDB (Mongoose) – Persistent storage for users and vault data
React (Vite) – Frontend framework and build tool
Tailwind CSS – Styling framework

Lucide React – Icon library
Wouter – Light-weight routing for React

BACKEND COMPONENTS :
1.app.js
* Starts the server
* Connects all routes and middleware
* Connects to MongoDB database
* Listens on port `3000`

2. Routes (src/routes/)
Routes decide which URL does what.
a) auth.routes.js- User authentication
* Accepts registration and login requests
* Validates user identity via proofs
* Generates JWT token for valid logins
* Handles logout events

b) vault.routes.js- Encrypted vault handling
* Upload encrypted vault data
* Fetch encrypted vault data for the authenticated owner
* Log debug info for payload size and ownership

3. Middleware (src/middleware/)
Middleware runs before routes.
a) auth.middleware.js- Token validation
* Reads `Authorization` header
* Decodes and verifies JWT token
* Attaches user info to request object

b) error.middleware.js- Error handling
* Catches server-side errors
* Sends standardized JSON error responses
* Prevents server crashes on unhandled exceptions

4. Models (src/models/)
Defines the structure of data in MongoDB.
a) user.model.js- User schema
* Stores username (email) and authentication proof
b) vault.model.js- Vault schema
* Stores username and encrypted vault string

5. Services (src/services/)
Services handle business logic.
auth.service.js- Authentication logic
* Handles user registration logic
* Verifies login credentials/proofs

6. Storage (src/storage/)
Abstraction layer for data persistence.
memory.store.js- Vault storage operations
* Interface for saving and retrieving vault data from MongoDB

CLOUD DATABASE : MongoDB Atlas (configured via .env)
